# Baking-Web-Page-Development
Capstone Project of the Hyperion Dev Bootcamp. Task is to design a webpages for a hobby of your interest.

I intend on gradually adding and developing more features to the web pages, and use it similar to a recipe app for myself when I do baking myself.

Plans for Improvement:
-Styling of the comments
-Provide user options to edit saved recipes list after saving
-Add more content to the saved recipes table (image along with the recipe)

Extra features:
-Unit conversion/selection (cups to mass like kg)
-Tips/Techniques page that are commonly used in baking, like technique to make the meringue for cake
-Recipe scaling with portion/serving size selection
